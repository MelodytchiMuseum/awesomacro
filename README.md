# Awesomacro
Simple text macro made in early 2016. Programmed in C#. Utilizes Michael Noonan's InputSimulator library.

The macro is small and is meant to run in the background. It was created for use in the video game Awesomenaut. Though designed for Awesomenauts specifically, it is not integrated with the game at all and could technically be used outside of the game.

Using the macro is simple. Simply create a text file in the same folder as the macro and populate the text file with desired responses. Each line is a new response. After opening the macro, simply press the INSERT key to have the macro randomly select a response and type it out. Responses will not be repeated until the entire response list is cycled through.
